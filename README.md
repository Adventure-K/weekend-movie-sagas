## Description

This app is a showcase of a selection of movies. The homepage presents the collection of titles and poster images, from which the user may then click on any movie to display a details view for that movie, which includes a description and a list of associated genres.

The homepage also has a button to bring the user to a form which can be used to add new movies to the collection. The user supplies a name and description and a URL to a poster image, and selects a genre for the movie.

All movie data are stored on a database and retrieved for the client through the use of Redux and Sagas. The front end is formatted with React.
